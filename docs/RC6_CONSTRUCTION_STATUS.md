# RC6 Construction Status

## Wave 4 implementation under qualification
- staged capability states: DISCOVERED / EXECUTABLE / REGISTERED / VISIBLE_TO_WORKER / PERMISSION_OK / PROBE_PASS / TARGET_READY / READY
- binary discovery alone never yields READY
- probe PASS requires real tool call and evidence references
- worker visibility/permission are scoped to exact worker
- target readiness is scoped to exact TargetIdentity
- admission is fail-closed for any missing stage
- tool call evidence may be recorded only after admission succeeds

## Current RED
`W4-CI-PROOF`: commit ToolCapabilityBroker plus regression tests, run GitHub Actions, and repair the first failing invariant only. Wave 5 remains blocked until Wave 4 is frozen.
